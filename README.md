## Designed and built a command line program that could do basic arithmetic/trigonometric/logarithmic operations (“+”,”-“,”*”,”/”, ”^”, sin, cos, tan, cot, arcsin, arccos, arctan, arcctg, ln, log10) with real numbers involving parenthesis, brackets, and curly brackets. The calculator software evaluates the mathematical formula based on the precedence of operators, parenthesis, and mathematical functions. This calculator also used a Polish Notation convertor that was created by another programmer, which was given credit in the code itself.
